# Welcome to Zymptom!

This mobile app allows users to input symptoms daily to help predict the next pandemic. To incentivize users, the more daily symptoms that are input, the longer the daily streak will be and the higher the rewards. Users with daily streaks will be given KureCoins which can then be used to purchase gift-cards for Amazon, the Google Play store and Spotify.

Help us prevent the next pandemic!

## Onboarding - Symptoms and Pre-Existing Health Conditions
You will first be asked to input your symptoms for that day along with any pre-existing health conditions. This will help other users determine how much at risk they are.
