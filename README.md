# Zymptom

This mobile app allows users to input daily symptoms to help predict the next pandemic. To incentivize users, the more daily symptoms that are input, the longer the daily streak will be and the higher the rewards. Users with daily streaks will be given KureCoins which can then be used to purchase gift-cards for Amazon, the Google Playstore and Spotify.

Help us fight the next pandemic before it gets here!
